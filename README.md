## House Prices Prediction
## Project Overview
This project aims to predict house prices using various machine learning algorithms. By analyzing a dataset that includes multiple features related to properties, such as location, size, and number of rooms, the goal is to create accurate models that can estimate the price of a house based on its characteristics.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains various features of houses, such as:

- Lot Area: The size of the lot in square feet.
- Overall Quality: Rates the overall material and finish of the house.
- Year Built: The year the house was originally built.
- Total Rooms: The total number of rooms (excluding bathrooms).
- Neighborhood: The location of the house in a specific area.
- SalePrice: The target variable representing the price of the house.

The dataset is sourced from Kaggle's House Prices dataset.

## Machine Learning Algorithms Used
The following machine learning algorithms were applied to the dataset:

- Linear Regression
- Ridge Regression
- Lasso Regression
- Decision Tree Regressor
- Random Forest Regressor
- Gradient Boosting Regressor
- XGBoost

## Feature Engineering
Feature engineering is a crucial part of the model-building process. The steps involved include:

- Handling missing values.
- Converting categorical variables into numerical formats using one-hot encoding.
- Creating new features based on existing data, such as the age of the house.
- Scaling and normalizing features to improve model performance.

## Model Evaluation
The models were evaluated using the following metrics:

- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): Measures the average magnitude of the errors.
- RÂ² Score: Represents the proportion of the variance for the dependent variable that's explained by the independent variables.
- Cross-validation techniques were also employed to ensure the models are not overfitting.
